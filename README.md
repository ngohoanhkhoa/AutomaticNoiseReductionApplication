# Automatic Noise Reduction Application
Application of noise reduction based on estimation of the noise level function by detecting non-parametrically homogeneous image regions

We propose an image application of noise reduction, which is based on the paper “Estimation of the noise level function based on a non-parametric detection of homogeneous image regions” of [Sutour et al, 2015]. In their research, they proposed an algorithm of estimating automatically the noise level function from a single image and applied in noise reduction with non local means algorithm. In our application, we provide a tool of noise reduction automatic with graphical user interface.
